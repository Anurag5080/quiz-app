Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get a local copy of the project up and running on your machine.

Prerequisites
You need to have Node.js (version 16 or later) and npm installed on your computer.

Installation & Setup
Clone the repository:

git clone [https://github.com/your-username/quiz-app-ts.git](https://github.com/your-username/quiz-app-ts.git)

Navigate to the project directory:

cd quiz-app-ts

Install the dependencies:

npm install

Run the development server:

npm run dev

The application will be available at http://localhost:5173. The server supports Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for a fast development experience.

Building for Production
To create a production-ready build of the app, run:

npm run build

This command bundles the application into the dist/ directory, optimized for deployment.

Architectural Decisions
State Management
Instead of relying on a large state management library like Redux, this project uses React's built-in Context API and useReducer hook (managed via the custom useQuiz hook). This approach was chosen because:

It is lightweight and sufficient for the application's needs, avoiding unnecessary boilerplate.

It encapsulates all quiz-related logic (state transitions, actions) into a single, cohesive unit (useQuiz.tsx), making the state management predictable and easy to maintain.

It provides a clean way for components to access and manipulate the quiz state without prop-drilling.

API Handling
Questions are fetched asynchronously from the Open Trivia DB. The application gracefully handles loading and error states, ensuring a smooth user experience even if the API call is slow or fails. A local questions.ts file is included as a fallback.

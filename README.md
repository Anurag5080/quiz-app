## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project locally.

### ‚úÖ Prerequisites

- **Node.js** v16 or later  
- **npm** (bundled with Node.js)

### ‚ö° Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/quiz-app-ts.git
2. **Navigate to the project directory**
   ```bash
   cd quiz-app
3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
4. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   
The application will be available at http://localhost:5173 with HMR (Hot Module Replacement) for a fast dev experience.

## üì¶ Building for Production
Create an optimized, production-ready build:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   This bundles the app into the ``` dist/ ``` directory, optimized and ready for deployment.

## üèó Architectural Decisions
   **‚öôÔ∏è State Management**
   
   Rather than using a large state library like Redux, this project uses React‚Äôs Context API with ``` useReducer ```, managed via a custom ``` useQuiz ``` hook. This approach was chosen because it:
   - Is **lightweight** and avoids unnecessary boilerplate.
   - Encapsulates all quiz logic (state transitions, actions) in a single, cohesive unit ```(useQuiz.tsx)```, making state predictable and easy to maintain.
   - Provides a clean way for components to **access and manipulate state** without prop-drilling
     
   **üåê API Handling**
   - Questions are fetched asynchronously from **Open Trivia DB**.
   - The app gracefully handles loading and error states for a smooth experience even on slow or failed requests.
   - A local ``` questions.ts ``` file is included as a **fallback**, ensuring the quiz still runs if the API fails.
